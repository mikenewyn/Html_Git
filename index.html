<p>
    After spending the last 16 years working in the restaurant industry I have decided to persue a different career. One I have been wanting get into for a very long time. This is what has lead me to where I am today, in this Coding Bootcamp. So far I am loving it! Learning to code will be a challenge, but one that I am enjoying so far.
</p>

<p>
    Other things I enjoy doing are spening time with my family, playing beach flag football, and watching movies. Life can be stressful, so it is important to remember to try to spend a good portion of it doing things that you love.

<p>
    Fun fact: I met my wife while playing against her in a champsionship game at the beach, and we now have a 16 month old baby at home!
